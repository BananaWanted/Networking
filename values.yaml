# control the in-container environment
# set this flag to true to use the testing image.
# more details:
#   For each CI build, 2 different images are pushed to the registry, one is for production, another for testing.
#   The prod image is basing on a minimized base image, usually alpine based or from scratch. Any non-necessary
#   files like tests / scripts are not included in this image.
#   The testing image is built for easy to use, thus usually dabian/ubuntu based. It not only
#   includes the full source files but also installs testing dependencies such as ipdb, pytest in python apps.
#   Another additional feature in the testing image is, the container command is wrapped in `bash`. Thus attaching to 
#   a running container and perform interactive debugging is possible.
